I am an Assistant Manager (Data Engineering) at KPMG UK, with over 4 years of experience in implementing data-driven solutions at Tier-1 organisations. My expertise spans data engineering, analytical workloads, backend frameworks, and entity resolution, using technologies such as Spark, Elasticsearch, Python, Postgres, Docker, and AWS. 

I am a quick learner who can absorb new, complex ideas and communicate them simply and effectively with clients, direct reports, and C-level executive teams. Additionally, I actively contribute to product deployment across various lifecycle stages.

Beyond my primary role, I have developed greenfield projects in Python. Currently, I‚Äôm building a sports booking app to help the local community easily find available venues in London.
