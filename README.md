I am an Assistant Manager (Data Engineering), with over 4 years of experience in implementing data-driven solutions at Tier-1 banks. My expertise spans data engineering, analytical workloads, backend frameworks, and entity resolution, using technologies such as Spark, Elasticsearch, Python, Postgres, Docker, and AWS. Beyond my primary role, I have developed greenfield projects in Python. Currently, Iâ€™m building a sports court-finder app called: [Sportscanner](https://www.sportscanner.co.uk/) to help the racket players easily find available venues in London.
