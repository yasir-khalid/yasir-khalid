Yasir is currently an Assistant manager at KPMG UK, and implements data-driven solutions for Tier-1 banks using Spark, Elasticsearch and Scala. He has a passion for technology, and loves developing ad-hoc web-apps on the side, using Python. 

Yasir's expertise spans data engineering and web analytics. He has also worked with global corporations, overseeing prototype development for a major tobacco manufacturer and contributed to product development in Audience measurement for Ipsos UK. 

Currently he‚Äôs implementing Quantexa‚Äôs solution for international trade finance using large scale entity resolution, and big data analytics - while working with cross-functional teams using Agile and Scrum methodologies - and upskilling on CI/CD pipelines across the product deployment journey. 

He likes learning about different parts of the software engineering lifecycle with the realisation that it's completely fine to be an average on a secondary technology than having no knowledge at all (helps you make better decisions and make teams move fast)
