I am an Assistant manager at KPMG UK, and implement data-driven solutions for Tier-1 banks using Spark, Elasticsearch, Microservices and AWS; and over the past 4 years specialising in data engineering, analytical workloads and enterprise release management

Currently I‚Äôm implementing Quantexa‚Äôs platform for financial crime using large-scale entity resolution, and big data analytics - while working closely with clients, and delivering stakeholder meetings, using Agile and Scrum methodologies.

I am gaining experience in different stages of a product development lifecycle, and focus on explaining complex technical products in a simplistic way using analogies and diagrams; while supporting end to end solutions for clients.

On the side, I love developing microservices in Python - and currently working on a sports search engine, to help the community find available playing venues near them.
